This is a simple project which uses HTML, CSS, and JS to create an interactive website which allows the user to generate a random password.
The user has the choice to allow the password to potentially include different characters, such as symbols, upper and lowercase letters, as well as numbers. The user may also edit the length from 8 to 24 characters.
